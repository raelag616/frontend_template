# frontend_template

Optimized template for front-end development with Sass and Node.js package manager.

For correct work you need:
1) Statable version of Node.js
2) Gulp installed witdh npm
2) Npm-check-updates installed with npm
3) Optional installed bower (not recomended if you not sure, that new version of library will not brake your project)

Until you begin to coding, update plugins versions with "npm -u" command and rewrite package.json file with your own description, name , etc.

After all prepearings, write down this commands in 
```sh
npm i
gulp watch
```
